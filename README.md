Sushiman is a visually captivating and responsive landing page built to showcase the essence of traditional Japanese cuisine through a modern digital experience. 
This project was developed using HTML5, CSS3, and powered by Vite for rapid frontend development and bundling.
Inspired by the principles of Omotenashi (Japanese hospitality), the website delivers a fluid and engaging interface featuring smooth animations (via AOS library) and a clean layout built with the BEM methodology. Whether you're displaying trending sushi, classic Japanese drinks, or building a food delivery brand presenceâ€”this design brings your content to life.
